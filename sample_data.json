You could query the results dynamically using a package like scholarly (<a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/scholarly/\">https://pypi.org/project/scholarly/</a>), but then it&#39;s not clear what your IR component is if Google is already pre-selecting results for you.\u00a0</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You could consider existing datasets in the academic domain like arXiv (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/help/bulk_data\">https://arxiv.org/help/bulk_data</a>) if it fits your project focus.</p>"

This leaves answering on Piazza for the class participation aspect of our grade. I currently have a 0/2 for class participation because I get very anxious trying to raise my hand in front of a big auditorium. Whenever I try to answer a question on Piazza, people answer it within 1 minute of posting. I had to change my email settings to receive an immediate email anytime someone posted a question to even try to have an attempt at answering a question, but even then, people are already answering it. I still leave answers,\u00a0 but none are deemed &#34;instructor-endorsed.&#34; Is there anything else I can do to increase my class participation? I feel like the current situation punishes those who are anxious to talk in front of so many people and is a battle to see who can type the fastest to the questions.\u00a0</p>"

Since everyone needs to scan their ID before they enter the room, we will start scanning people into the room approximately 15 minutes before the exam starts.\u00a0 Apologies in advance for the line, the school only provided us with two ID scanners.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After your ID is scanned you should proceed immediately to your assigned seat. Do not enter the room or take a seat before you scan your ID.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After you are at your designated seat put your Cornell ID next to your where your name is indicated on the cheatsheet.

Row numbering starts from the left of each row (as you face the blackboard). For example, Row A, Seat 1 is the seat closest to the left wall and blackboard.\u00a0 Please make note of your seat assignment before you enter the lecture hall (and write it on your cheatsheet, see below), and after checking in with the TAs (see above) go straight to the seat assigned to you to avoid any delays. If your seat is defective or you are unable to write please raise your hand and the course staff will assist you.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We acknowledge that Uris G01 does not provide the best conditions for writing, but we need to work with what we have.\u00a0 We took this into account in determining the time-to-content ratio for the exam.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Cheatsheet</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As previously indicated, you are allowed to bring and use one handwritten sheet of letter or A4-sized paper (front and back).\u00a0 The cheatsheet must be handwritten by you. No xerox-copies, print-outs or digital versions will be allowed. Before you come to the exam, you need to clearly write your name, netID and (importantly) the seat number that was assigned to you on the cheatsheet. \u00a0 Cross out all large blocks of unwritten space on BOTH sides.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you do not plan to prepare a cheatsheet, bring an empty page with your name, netID and the seat number that was assigned to you.\u00a0 Write NO CHEATSHEET on it and cross out all the unwritten space on BOTH sides.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Before the exam starts</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once you are in your pre-assigned seat, you should have received two notebooks.\u00a0 Do not open any of them before you are told to do so. Print your name, netid and seat (row, seat number) on the cover page of each notebook, read the instructions carefully and sign at the bottom of the cover pages.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>During the exam</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Read the problems from the Problem Notebook and write your answers in the Answer Notebook.\u00a0 You are only allowed to write in the Answers Notebook. You can use the back side of the pages in the Answer Notebook as draft space (but keep in mind that we will not grade that).\u00a0 Extra pages are provided at the end of the Answer Notebook if you need to extra space for the solution of the problems.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You <strong>MUST</strong> write your netID on each page of your Answer Notebook (do this after the exam starts).\u00a0 We can not grade any page that does not have your netID on it.\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What not to do</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Any form of communication between you and another student will result in your exclusion from the exam (regardless of who initiated that communication).\u00a0 If you have anything to communicate, raise your hand and wait for the course staff to come to you. If any other exam-taker is trying to communicate with you, it is your responsibility to signal that to the course staff by raising your hand.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do not look on any other student\u2019s answers/notes, and make sure you do not show your answers/notes to other students, as both constitute reasons for exclusion from the exam. \u00a0 If any of the students sitting next to you makes you feel uncomfortable, raise your hand and wait for the course staff to come to you.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Remember to go to the restroom before the exam starts.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>When you finish the exam. Case 1: after the exam time expires</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Place the Answers Notebook and your cheatsheet in your Problem Notebook and wait in your seat for the course staff to come collect your exam.\u00a0 Make sure to hand in all three documents (the two notebooks and your cheatsheet) to the course staff before leaving your seat. Please be patient to allow enough time for the course staff to account for your exam materials. \u00a0 Under no circumstance should you leave the lecture hall with any of these (notebooks or cheatsheets), as your exam will be invalidated.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>When you finish the exam. Case 2: before the exam time expires</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Place the Answers Notebook and your cheatsheet in your Problem Notebook and raise your hand holding these three documents in your hand.\u00a0 The course staff will come and collect them from you. Please be patient and avoid disturbing any of your colleagues that are still taking the exam.\u00a0 After your exam is collected and accounted for, you will be told when you can leave the room (we\u2019ll do that at certain times, to minimize the disturbance to students that are still taking the exam).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Under no circumstance should you leave the lecture hall with any of the materials (notebooks or cheatsheet), as your exam will be invalidated.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\u00a0</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Good luck!</p>\n<p><br /></p>"

For example, if we have term_1 appear in doc_1 and doc_3 but term_2 only appear in doc_2 and doc_3, then\u00a0after the matrix multiplications, the indices (1,2) and (2,1) will just be equal to 1.

For example, a user might want to search for entries about laptops yet in the database all such machines are referred to as notebook computers. In such a scenario, we need to expand our query terms (probably including notebook computer) either through pre-compiled data or through automated ways like an automated thesaurus. The need for automated expansion naturally leads to the need to find related words which is fulfilled by the use of word embeddings.\u00a0</p>"

So the probability that the document is non-relevant is defined as (the number of times judge 1 says a document is non-relevant &#43; the number of times judge 2 says a document is non-relevant) / (total number of documents). So the expected probability is calculated that both are non-relevant or both are relevant</p>",
